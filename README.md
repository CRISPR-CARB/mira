# MIRA

MIRA is a framework for representing systems using ontology-grounded **meta-model templates**, and generating various model implementations and exchange formats from these templates. It also implements algorithms for assembling and querying **domain knowledge graphs** in support of modeling.

Example notebooks:
  - Defining multiple model variants using MIRA Templates: [notebook](https://github.com/indralab/mira/blob/main/notebooks/metamodel_intro.ipynb)
  - Generating an executable model from MIRA Templates and running simulation: [notebook](https://github.com/indralab/mira/blob/main/notebooks/simulation.ipynb)
